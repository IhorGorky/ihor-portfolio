                <h3>Hidden object scenes for Vampire: The Masquerade</h3>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>The Cabinet of the Prince</em></p>
                <p><strong>Context:</strong> An extraordinary event has occurred at the Prince's estate - someone has stolen an ancient artifact. The player is tasked with secretly searching the Prince's personal office and finding traces of the missing artifact before it becomes public knowledge.</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> The Prince's personal office.</p>
                <p><strong>Task:</strong> Find 10 key objects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clan Seal</li>
                    <li>Torn sheet</li>
                    <li>Glass with blood remains</li>
                    <li>Book with a torn page</li>
                    <li>Hidden safe behind the portrait</li>
                    <li>Seal impression in wax</li>
                    <li>Diary with coded entries</li>
                    <li>Broken old amulet</li>
                    <li>Postcard with a strange signature</li>
                    <li>Drops of old, dried blood near the desk</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="twist">
                    <strong>Twist:</strong> The search reveals a hidden fact: the artifact was stolen not by enemies, but by someone from the Prince's inner circle.
                </div>
                <p><strong>Feature:</strong> Found objects can be used to open new plot branches (blackmail, information trading, etc.).</p>

                <h3>Branching quest for Vampire: The Masquerade</h3>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> <em>Silence in the Tremere Tower</em></p>
                <p><strong>Brief description:</strong> The player is invited to the Tremere Tower for a "casual chat" after a suspicious incident on Elysium.</p>
                <p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Tremere offer a test: hand over the name of their ally, allegedly involved in the Masquerade breach, in exchange for power.</li>
                    <li>The player has three options:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Betray an ally</strong> → Gain a possible benefit, but lose an ally (consequences for several missions ahead).</li>
                            <li><strong>Refuse to answer</strong> → Lose Tremere reputation, but retain honor and an ally.</li>
                            <li><strong>To tell a lie</strong> → Give a fake name and possibly provoke an internal war between clans (a risky but potentially profitable move).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Final:</strong> The result affects the character's reputation among the Camarilla and can open or close the way to some influential characters.</p>

                <h3>Example of a dialogue scene for D&D</h3>
                <p><strong>Scene name:</strong> <em>Meeting in the Dungeon</em></p>
                <p>The player character meets an Informant who has knowledge of the path to a hidden treasure in an ancient dungeon.</p>
                <p><strong>Place:</strong> Narrow corridor, dilapidated part of the dungeon, dim light of torches.</p>
                <p><strong>Informant (NPC):</strong></p>
                <p>"Have you come for the treasure? You have no idea what price it comes at..."</p>
                <p><strong>Player action options:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I am ready for anything. Lead me." <em>NPC reaction:</em> The informant sees the determination and agrees to help without further checks. <em>Consequence:</em> The player receives a map or escort to a specific location.</li>
                    <li>"I'm not afraid. Tell me what you know." <em>Verification required:</em> → Persuasion DC 12. <em>Success:</em> The informant agrees to reveal important information without escort. <em>Fail:</em> The informant laughs and disappears into the darkness, leaving no clues.</li>
                    <li>"I will find my own way. Goodbye." <em>NPC reaction:</em> The informant throws up his hands and disappears. <em>Consequence:</em> The player loses the opportunity to learn the easy way out. Further exploration of the dungeon becomes more difficult and possibly more fun (e.g., more Survival or Dexterity checks are required to avoid traps).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Mechanics:</strong> Skill Checks: used to determine the outcome of negotiations.</p>
                <p><strong>Impact on the game:</strong> The player gains or loses an advantage in subsequent tasks depending on the decision.</p>

            <h2>Final words</h2>
            <p>I love creating stories that players will remember long after they've finished the game. I'm sure that together we can make a great game - with captivating storylines, interesting choices, and worlds that you'll want to return to.</p>
            <p>My whole life has been filled with immersion in other people's worlds - through books, movies, games. And now, having accumulated this incredible experience, I feel a powerful desire to transform it into my own creations, to become the one who gives life to worlds.</p>
            <p>I am ready for new challenges and would be happy to become part of your team!</p>
